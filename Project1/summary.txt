In this lab I learned a lot about processes and relearned data structures. I had some difficulty with the pointers in those data structure and had to learn a lot of debugging techniques because of segmentaion faults. I used a debugger in VScode, log files, and lots of print statements to debug the code before submition. Overall, this was a very fun project that I enjoyed completing.
