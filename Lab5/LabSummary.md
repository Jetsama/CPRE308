In this lab I created 4 different scheduling functions. These were first come first served, least remaining time, round robin and round robin priority. Efficiently was not a priority in these functions. Most functions were self explainitory to understand and implement. I gained a better understanding of round robin. One issue I ran into was setting defaults. If I were to recreate these functions I would move the return -1 conditions to the end of the functions for better clarity at which states it should continue with the current process.
