    Lab 8
    Introduction to SSH and GnuPG

    In this lab we discuessed multiple different I have had a lot of experience with SSH connections in the past. I found the talk on key autentication was very intresting. I did not often use SCP because I have gotten used to working with VS codes SSH server.
    Another aspect that I had not used was the GnuPG for key generation and encyption. I think one another thing that might be helpful to learn about would be WSL for those using windows.
