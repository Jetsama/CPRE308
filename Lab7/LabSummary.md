In this lab, we discuss the FAT-12 File. FAT stands for File Allocation Table. This is probably the most useful lab for learning how about how the systems work and how much abstraction is given to modern programmers. There is so many steps along the way where an error can occur. It also shows the importance of standards in files and file systems as well as showing the differences over time. Implementing multiple different formats takes more code and time to read. I like that a lot of the code was pre-implemented but I feel that it would be intresting to design a project around creating a file system similar to the COMS 352 project.
